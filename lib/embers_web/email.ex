defmodule EmbersWeb.Email do
  @moduledoc """
  A module for sending emails to the user.
  This module provides functions to be used with the Phauxth authentication
  library when confirming users or handling password resets. It uses
  Bamboo, with the Mandrill adapter, to email users. For tests, it uses
  a test adapter, which is configured in the config/test.exs file.
  If you want to use a different email adapter, or another email
  library, read the instructions below.
  ## Bamboo with a different adapter
  Bamboo has adapters for Mailgun, Mailjet, Mandrill, Sendgrid, SMTP,
  SparkPost, PostageApp, Postmark and Sendcloud.
  There is also a LocalAdapter, which is great for local development.
  See [Bamboo](https://github.com/thoughtbot/bamboo) for more information.
  ## Other email library
  If you do not want to use Bamboo, follow the instructions below:
  1. Edit this file, using the email library of your choice
  2. Remove the lib/forks_the_egg_sample/mailer.ex file
  3. Remove the Bamboo entries in the config/config.exs and config/test.exs files
  4. Remove bamboo from the deps section in the mix.exs file
